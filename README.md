## Python Password Manager 

This code is currently simple, it can generate and encrypt a random 10 char password (obviously can decrypt too...), but im working to upgrade this.

### Install guide 

Create a folder

> cd 'nameofyoufolder'

> git clone https://github.com/Mormito/PasswordManager

> pip install cryptography

> python main.py
